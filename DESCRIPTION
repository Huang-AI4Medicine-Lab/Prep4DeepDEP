Description: Prep4DeepDEP is an R package to prepare the input and output data files required by the Python package of DeepDEP (https://codeocean.com/capsule/3348251/tree/). DeepDEP is a deep learning model that uses the baseline genomic profiles of cancer cell lines (CCLs) or tumors to predict their gene dependencies (i.e., the degree to which knocking out a gene inhibits the survival of cancer cells).
    Please refer to the paper and DeepDEP package about how to use the generated data tables for DeepDEP model training and prediction.
